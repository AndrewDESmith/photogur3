<!-- The edit and delete links use different code because the edit link takes the user to a separate page (using the edit_picture_path alias), while the delete link takes the current picture (whose id is available from the show page's context) and applies the delete HTTP request to the picture's url as an option of the link_to helper. (I think?) -->
<!-- The URL is /picture (which is denoted in this code with @picture), and the HTTP request is DELETE -->
